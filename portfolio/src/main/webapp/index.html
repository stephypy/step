            It all started with a book. I was a freshman in high school watching
            a ceremony celebrating seniors and their accomplishments. I was
            sitting down, reading a silly young adult fiction book while the
            principal kept congratulating seniors and saying how proud he was of
            them; he kept mentioning things like winner of a writing competiton,
            captain of the football team, state winner of a math competition,
            best senior trumpet player, president of the debate team, etcetera
            and etcetera. As he was listing all those accomplishments, the
            protagonist of my novel was wondering whether her good grades were
            worth anything without extracurricular activites. At some point I
            pause and ask my friend sitting next to me if she could repeat what
            she had told me about the robotics club she was in.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>"Oh yeah! You should join next year. I'll text you the info."</b>
            I didn't know what I was signing myself up for, but I figured if the
            protagonist of my novel was running for class president, I had
            nothing to lose by joining a club I had no experience in.
          </p>

          <p>
            As soon as robotics was recruiting new members, I walked in to the
            room excited to do something more than just get A's, but soon
            regretted even thinking about it after hearing people talking and
            asking questions about engineering. Almost everyone in the room was
            in a STEM program. I was not. I felt nervous and ashamed of even
            being there; what could I possibly even contribute to the team? My
            friend had told me I didn't need to know anything to join, but I
            started doubting her words.
          </p>

          <p>

              >"Most people join to be part of the building team, but if you are
              interested in programming, let us know"</b
            >
            The robotics teacher said. No one said anything or raised their hand
            and in the coming days I learned there was only one programmer in
            the team. I had never coded a single line in my life and I had
            completely forgotten programming was something that existed, but no
            one wanted to do it so I decided to give it a try. I never expected
            to like programming and I never expected to make an impact on the
            team; I learned Java and started writing small programs to make the
            robot move, namely to grab objects, launch objects, and navigate on
            the arena. Sometimes I like to joke my first program was to make a
            robot move instead of the standard "Hello World." Despite of the
            competitions that my team and I attended (and occassionally won), I
            was aware that there was so much I didn't know and so much I had to
            learn. My high school didn't have a programming class at the time,
            so I taught myself how to code, but even though I was able to
            accomplish a lot thanks to robotics and the support of my team, I
            also knew I was still a beginner in computer science.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once I started college, I finally began to learn the concepts I
            didn't know I had been using all along. I was surprised to learn
            about methods, objects, data types; things I had been using without
            knowing them. Through all these years, I have learned data
            structures and learned about the different fields computer science
            offers. I started with robotics because I wanted to accomplish
            something just like the seniors from my high school or the
            protagonist of my YA novel, but now as a college student I am
            interested in frontend and UI/UX to design products that are
            pleasing and easy to use and also data analytics and learning how
            data can help create or improve a product. My interests might change
            over the years, but I can say computer science is everywhere and
            more importantly, I have fun being part of it.
