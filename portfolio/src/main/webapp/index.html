                    It all started with a book. I was a freshman in high school watching a ceremony celebrating seniors and their accomplishments. I was sitting down, reading a silly young adult fiction book while
                    the principal kept congratulating seniors and saying how proud he was of them; he kept mentioning things like winner of a writing competiton, captain of the football team, state winner of a math 
                    competition, best senior trumpet player, president of the debate team, etcetera and etcetera. As he was listing all those accomplishments, the protagonist of my novel was wondering whether her 
                    good grades were worth anything without extracurricular activites. At some point I pause and ask my friend sitting next to me if she could repeat what she had told me about the robotics club she was in. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>"Oh yeah! You should join next year. I'll text you the info."</b> I didn't know what I was signing myself up for, but I figured if the protagonist of my novel was running for class president, I had 
                    nothing to lose by joining a club I had no experience in. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As soon as robotics was recruiting new members, I walked in to the room excited to do something more than just get A's, but soon regretted even thinking about it after hearing people talking and asking 
                    questions about engineering. Almost everyone in the room was in a STEM program. I was not. I felt nervous and ashamed of even being there; what could I possibly even contribute to the team? My friend had 
                    told me I didn't need to know anything to join, but I started doubting her words. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>"Most people join to be part of the building team, but if you are interested in programming, let us know"</b> The robotics teacher said. No one said anything or raised their hand and in the coming days I 
                    learned there was only one programmer in the team. I had never coded a single line in my life and I had completely forgotten programming was something that existed, but no one wanted to do it so I decided 
                    to give it a try. I never expected to like programming and I never expected to make an impact on the team; I learned Java and started writing small programs to make the robot move, namely to grab objects, 
                    launch objects, and navigate on the arena. Sometimes I like to joke my first program was to make a robot move instead of the standard "Hello World." Despite of the competitions that my team and I attended 
                    (and occassionally won), I was aware that there was so much I didn't know and so much I had to learn. My high school didn't have a programming class at the time, so I taught myself how to code, but even 
                    though I was able to accomplish a lot thanks to robotics and the support of my team, I also knew I was still a beginner in computer science.

                <p>
                    Once I started college, I finally began to learn the concepts I didn't know I had been using all along. I was surprised to learn about methods, objects, data types; things I had been using without knowing 
                    them. Through all these years, I have learned data structures and learned about the different fields computer science offers. I started with robotics because I wanted to accomplish something just like the 
                    seniors from my high school or the protagonist of my YA novel, but now as a college student I am interested in frontend and UI/UX to design products that are pleasing and easy to use and also data analytics 
                    and learning how data can help create or improve a product. My interests might change over the years, but I can say computer science is everywhere and more importantly, I have fun being part of it.
